# Peaceful Sanctuary

**Peaceful Sanctuary** hides enemy nameplates while in a sanctuary and out of combat. This allows the player to automatically hide the blue health bars of the opposite faction players on Burning Crusade Classic realms to reduce the screen clutter, since enemy player nameplates are always visible when turned on, regardless of reaction.
